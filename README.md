This Wabbajack list is a comprehensive collection of nearly 2000 mods for Skyrim Anniversary Edition, curated to provide an immersive and romantic experience centered around Serana from the Dawnguard DLC. Built around the popular mod 'Serana Dead Sexy: The Queen of Screams' and integrated with 'Legacy of the Dragonborn' (Legacy of the Dragonborn), it enhances Serana's appearance, dialogue, and interactions, focusing on mature and intimate themes. 

Note: This is an NSFW (Not Safe For Work) modlist and the ANNIVERSARY EDITION IS REQUIRED.  A derivate list (because why reinvent the wheel) "Mara's Blessings" is in the works and will not include the SDS content or require the anniversary edition. 

REQUIREMENTS:

Post-Installation:
Launch the game using the SKSE launcher through Mod Organizer﻿ which is included in the list. I Have named it "Use this" 
It will take a few minutes to load the main menu, ENB must Compile shaders and the game must load 2289 Plugins.
Saves are Unique. 
If you have a high resolution display (such as 4k) you should update the SSE Display Tweaks line 65 "Resolution = 2560x1440" to match your display.
Stay in the cave for a few minutes while MCMs and mod configurations load. After "museum list building complete" appears, you can tweak mod settings to your liking or go into MCM recorder and run the "default." Some Users did not like the bathing mechanics so auto was disabled. 

Additional Files Needed BEFORE running Wabbajack, ensure these files are in your designated downloads folder (you may be prompted but this will reduce installation issues):
