# 🌌 Whispers of Mara

*In the shadowed realms of Skyrim, where ancient prophecies clash with the beating hearts of destiny, a divine murmur echoes through the frost-kissed winds—the Whispers of Mara, goddess of eternal love.*

As the Dragonborn—whether valiant hero or fierce heroine—you’ll embark on a sweeping saga of passion and peril. Every stolen glance amid dragonfire could ignite a flame that defies the ages.

- Explore **Legacy of the Dragonborn**  Legacy of the Dragonborn SSE is a massive, DLC‑sized expansion for Skyrim Special Edition that transforms the game into a museum‑driven adventure. At its heart is the Dragonborn Gallery in Solitude, a sprawling museum where you can collect and display over 4,500 unique artifacts from Skyrim and supported mods. Beyond the displays, it introduces the Explorer’s Society, a new guild you build from the ground up, complete with questlines, radiant adventures, and major story arcs. With hundreds of hours of content, Legacy weaves exploration, lore, and collection into a single experience, making it a true foundation for an entire playthrough. Relic Hunter Alternate start included so you can get straight to it. 

- **3DNPCS** Interesting NPCs (3DNPC), also known as Interesting NPCs SE, is a massive content mod that breathes life into Skyrim by adding over 250 fully voiced NPCs, more than 25 followers, 15 marriage candidates, and 50+ quests. Each character is written with depth, backstory, and branching dialogue trees that let you role‑play in new ways—whether as a hero, trickster, or villain. Many of these NPCs are voiced by a large cast of community actors, giving them unique personalities and immersive interactions. The mod also introduces “super followers” with thousands of lines of commentary, reacting dynamically to quests and locations across Skyrim. It’s widely regarded as one of the most ambitious projects for expanding the game’s world with lore‑friendly storytelling and role‑play opportunities.*Fair notice this mod is known to cause crashes*
  
**Oromance Plus or Nether's Framework Elope Features**: ORomance Plus is an expanded relationship and romance framework built on the Ostim suite, designed to completely rework Skyrim’s limited marriage system. It allows you to pursue romances with virtually any NPC, with mechanics for dating, flings, long‑term relationships, and marriage. The mod introduces features like polygamy, break‑ups, divorces, and a revamped gift/compliment system, while also adding unique interactions for characters such as Serana and Frea. With a dedicated UI separate from vanilla dialogue, customizable MCM options, and even a Safe‑for‑Work mode, ORomance Plus offers a flexible, immersive way to role‑play love, loyalty, and desire in Skyrim’s harsh world  V15: added M.A.R.A.S - Marry Anyone Rule All Skyrim https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/159033
