This Wabbajack list is a collection of nearly 2000 mods for Skyrim Anniversary Edition, curated to provide an immersive and romantic experience centered around Serana from the Dawnguard DLC. Built around the popular mod 'Serana Dead Sexy: The Queen of Screams' and integrated with 'Legacy of the Dragonborn' (Legacy of the Dragonborn), it enhances Serana's appearance, dialogue, and interactions, focusing on mature and intimate themes. 

Note: This is an NSFW (Not Safe For Work) modlist and the ANNIVERSARY EDITION IS REQUIRED.  

Update for Version 5: 5 Alpha: Awaiting on Wabbajack Whitelist pull Requests. This is to ensure mods that you download are not being illegally redistributed or coming from unauthorized sources.

Installation Guide for Wabbajack

Download Wabbajack from Wabbajack.org﻿.
Download the modlist file manually from Nexus Mods﻿. (This modlist).
Open Wabbajack, click on "Install from Disk", and select the modlist file you downloaded.

You'll need at least 360GB for the Mod Organizer 2 Instance
Set up a Resource Download Folder:
This can be on anywhere drive, but recommend at least 207GB of space. (567GB Total)
latest Version 670GB total at this time
More details on installation can be found at Wabbajack's Wiki﻿.
Download the files listed below and place them in the downloads folder you established. While technically not required, it will greatly increase success rate especially if websites are down. 


Post-Installation:
Launch the game using the SKSE launcher through Mod Organizer﻿ which is included in the list. I Have named it "Use this" 
It will take a few minutes to load the main menu, ENB must Compile shaders and the game must load 2289 Plugins.
Saves are Unique. 
If you have a high resolution display (such as 4k) you should update the SSE Display Tweaks line 65 "Resolution = 2560x1440" to match your display.
If you have low VRAM you can attempt to mitigate issues by removing the "#' on line 68 of SSE Display tweaks to enable lower resolution rendering. 
Stay in the cave for a few minutes while MCMs and mod configurations load. After "museum list building complete" appears, you can tweak mod settings to your liking or go into MCM recorder and run the "default." Some Users did not like the bathing mechanics so auto was disabled. 

Additional Files Needed BEFORE running Wabbajack, ensure these files are in your designated downloads folder (you may be prompted but this will reduce installation issues):
