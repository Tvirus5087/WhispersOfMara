In the frost-kissed shadows of Skyrim, where the goddess of love murmurs forbidden In the shadowed realms of Skyrim, where ancient prophecies clash with the beating hearts of destiny, a divine murmur echoes through the frost-kissed winds—the Whispers of Mara, goddess of eternal love. As the Dragonborn, whether a valiant hero or a fierce heroine, you'll embark on a sweeping saga of passion and peril, where every stolen glance amid dragonfire could ignite a flame that defies the ages. Delve into the storied halls of Legacy of the Dragonborn, unearthing relics that weave tales of forbidden desires and unbreakable bonds. Cross paths with dozens of enigmatic new companions, each harboring secrets and dreams, offering their hands in marriage to forge alliances as deep as the Nordic seas. And for those elusive souls who once seemed beyond reach, unlock hidden paths to matrimony, turning fleeting encounters into lifelong vows. From steel and sorcery to star crossed lovers.

Unique or rarely used mods: Starting up. Due to the increased difficulty of combat, this allows you to preemptively customize things for each new game (or load) that you do. In this case I have buffed health, magicka, and stamina as you will be quickly "swarmed" with enemies especially at night. 
NPC & Appearance overhaul base(s): Modpocalypse v3: All vanilla NPCs this is flagged as ESM so that will always load before any custom replacer you have for your favorites, Exquisite NPCs uses skypatcher to greatly improve NPC appearances, simply disable them in the sky patcher files if you want your own replacer, AI Overhaul SSE, 3BA & diamond Skin, TNG/HIMBO & Skysight Ultra SOS full. 
Expectations: Increased combat difficulty, immersive, semi-lore friendly, gorgeous dames and handsome hunks, lots of companions you can marry and most of all hundred of hours of adventures. 

I will upload an excel sheet with all mods and links in github repository and on the nexus page.
