This Wabbajack list is a collection of nearly 2000 mods for Skyrim Anniversary Edition, curated to provide an immersive and romantic experience centered around Serana from the Dawnguard DLC. Built around the popular mod 'Serana Dead Sexy: The Queen of Screams' and integrated with 'Legacy of the Dragonborn' (Legacy of the Dragonborn), it enhances Serana's appearance, dialogue, and interactions, focusing on mature and intimate themes. 

IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT SERANA DEAD SEXY: THE QUEEN OF SCREAMS IS PLEASE VIEW THE NEXUS PAGE. IT IS NOT A SERANA REPLACER IT IS A TOTAL OVERHAUL AND WILL PLACE LOTS OF NAKED NPCS IN THE WORLD. https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73589

Note:ANNIVERSARY EDITION IS REQUIRED.  Nexus Mods Membership is required (free tier ok) Available Mega download quota (10Gb or so should be fine) and it is recommended to have a Patreon account and add chiminy's free tier at https://www.patreon.com/c/CHIMinyCricket/home.

USER PREPERATION: 
Ensure that Skyrim is installed outside of the C:\ Drive - Failure to do this may result in failure to launch as others have experienced. Move your installation from that drive if needed. 
Ensure that all Creations from the Anniversary Edition are downloaded. These files cannot be included in the modlist. Patches to clean them will be installed by Wabbjack - According to WJ Moderators. 
Ensure that there are no preexisting ENB Files or old SKSE files, or plugins installed by other mod managers such as manual installations, extra creations or vortex installations. 

Installation: 
Determine where you will install the modlist. It should be X:\Modlistlocation where X = The same drive as skyrim. 
Create a folder for the modlist.
In that folder create a folder called downloads. 
Install the predownload requirements. Links are below.  For the most part Wabbajack will prompt you if you need to download something. However predownloading will allow you to save headaches in case a file needs to come from a mirror instead of main location. If it has issues it will make an HTML file with links you can download. Ensure there are no (1) or (2) etc at the end of the file if multiples are downloaded. 
Click Browse modlists and then select install from disk. ensure the install and download folders match what you created
Click install

Post-Installation:
SKSE has been renamed for M02 to "Whispers of Mara" It should be the default option and you can click run. 
A splash screen will appear as SKSE plugins are loaded.
Upon initial entry into the game ENB will begin building Shaders. YOUR SCREEN WILL BE BLACK DURING THIS TIME. Depending on your system, this may take some time. Test system with NVME GEN3 drive: 4 Minutes to main menu. 
Upon Starting a new game MCM Recorder will Begin establishing default settings. If its not your first, then some mods may auto load their settings. You can ignore the MCM errors for these. 
UBE Characters may appear naked as not all armors have UBE Patches. 
You may also need to reopen Racemenu for UBE Characters and then Save after switching areas. 

Additional Files Needed BEFORE running Wabbajack, ensure these files are in your designated downloads folder (you may be prompted but this will reduce installation issues):

IF ANY DOWNLOADS FAIL, YOU WILL GET A FAILED DOWNLOAD REPORT COPY THE ACTUAL LINK AND DOWNLOAD IT MANUALLY INTO YOUR DOWNLOADS FOLDER.

If you would like to use this modlist as a base or "jumpstart list" be sure that the downloads folder is included where your M02 instance will be: "Instance\downloads" so that the meta files will be available to you more easily and you can remove uninstalled mods faster.
